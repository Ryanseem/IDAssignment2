# The Weather detector website

For this project,I decide to make weather detector website. In this website, I will be using Openweathermap api to gather weather data and display the result of location input.

## Design Process
The purpose of this website is to create and simple and efficient weather detector application to use using Openweathermap API.T

For the website, I create a responsive website where is responsive which mean is suitable for phone to use. for I create a navigation bar, which consist of home, feature and api , for user to click into other pages.

I create buttons for user to direct into the other page
## Features
I have put the API feature into the website where the user can just use to find the weather in any location on th globe
For the page on API, I have code it where it generate random background image whenever a search of weather has done


### In the future, features that I may add inside:
* Other openweathermap API that are available in their website such as Hourly forecast,climate forecast and etc to make an application with multifunction on weather 

# Technologies Used

* Html - for the input of content of the website 
* Css - for the input of style of the website
* Javascript - for the API of the website

# Testing

* if the code in javascript related to API is wrong, a message will display such a 'no weather found'.
* if user input location that does not exist in the search bar, a message will display such a 'no weather found'.
